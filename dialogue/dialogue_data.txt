1:Amidst the unending toll, I shimmer, resolute, embracing the cacophony's rhythm. As the    ringing persists, my essence weaves resilience into this spectral prison's hymn.
2:With each ding and dong, my glow dims, a disco ball losing its spark. I yearn for silence  as the tolls take their toll, turning me into a fading arc.
3:In the jamboree of jingles, I groove like a wobbly note, a spectral dance so dandy.        Lockdown or not, I'm the party host, turning clinks and clanks into something quite randy.
4:As the clatter goes on, my radiance retreats, a disco ball caught in a rave. If only I could twinkle as I used to, instead of fading like a retiree's wave. Take my Soul as your Key. 
5:HA! YOU FOUND THE MAD HATTER! Beneath the moon's enchanting light, we find our trance.
